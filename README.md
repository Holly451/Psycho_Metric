# Psycho_Metric
This is a hodge podge set of coding files used for a variety of psychometric projects.

The VBA files are cleaning, summarizing, and file making modules done in visual basic for applications, specifically Microsoft Excel.

The MPLUS files are for structural equation modeling, regression modeling, multi-level modeling, & longitudinal modeling.

The C# files are for a variety of helpful apps for educators.

The Python files will hopefully lead into coding psychometric analyses via machine learning, neural networks, and other AI-type endeavors.
